/// MapStateManager is the place to keep a succession of events or "states" when building 
/// a multi-step AI demo. Note that this is a way to manage 
/// 
/// State changes could happen for one of two reasons:
///     when the user has pressed a number key 0..9, desiring a new phase
///     when something happening in the game forces a transition to the next phase
/// 
/// One use will be for AI demos that are switched up based on keyboard input. For that, 
/// the number keys 0..9 will be used to dial in whichever phase the user wants to see.
